# Datateknologer
The website for DAG, the company relations committ√© at Datateknologsektionen, Chalmers

## How to edit
To change DAG members on the front page you have to edit `web/src/config.ts`. You can replace the profile pictures in `web/src/assets/profiles` or add new ones and import them just like the current profile pictures.

Texts on the front page can be edited in `web/src/views/Home.vue`, the other pages can also be edited in the same folder. The footer and header can be found in `web/src/components`.
